Student Management System!!!

The system was implemented using C programming language.

Necessary header files used are: stdio(standard input output), stlid(standard library) and string(to handle string operations).

The objective of the system was to handle the student records in an efficient manner. 
And, thus different functions have been created as per the necessities.

Different functions created are:
1. Insert: to handle all the entries to be inputted.
2. Search: to assist user with searching different entries in the library.
3. Update: to deal with the entries that needs updating.
4. Delete: to delete the entries that no longer need storing. 
5. Display: to display the entries existing in the library.


We have tried our best to keep our programming detailed yet understandable.
We hope we have been of help.
Thank you.
